I lagged once and this happens
And that's what I get for touching that
I got mauled by cancer
I think my brain cells died a long with my character
Aw man
Alright I have PTSD of /keyent/ now
I legit dont understand. How could /keyent/ cause so much damage?
Once again I died
Oh great now I look like a clown
This death could of been worse than the time I managed to get stuck under the airboat in half life 2 and drowned to death
